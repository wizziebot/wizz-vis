The Dashboard is where it all comes together. Dashboards can be considered as a set of one or more Widgets.

The dashboards are built in a grid layout system with 12 columns and it's responsive.

## Theme

Each dashboard can be customized with two different themes, `light` and `dark`.

### Light Theme

![light-theme]({{ '/assets/images/light-theme.png' | relative_url }}){: .align-center}

### Dark Theme

![dark-theme]({{ '/assets/images/dark-theme.png' | relative_url }}){: .align-center}

## Reload

Dashboard can be configured to make an automatic reload periodically.

The options are:
* No reload
* 30 seconds
* 1 minute
* 5 minutes
* 15 minutes
* 30 minutes
* 1 hour
* 2 hours

![dashboard-reload]({{ '/assets/images/dashboard-reload.png' | relative_url }}){: .align-center}

## Lock

The dashboards can be blocked, not allowing the creation of new widgets or the modification of the position of these.

![dashboard-locked]({{ '/assets/images/dashboard-locked.png' | relative_url }}){: .align-center}
