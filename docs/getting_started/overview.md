Wizz-Vis is based on grid dashboards, responsive design and has a wide variety of widgets, among which are time series, pies, tables, heatmaps, geolocation, asset routes and much more, as well as features such as interval comparison and customization of appearance. Likewise, Wizz-Vis support plugins, adding a new set of widgets depending on the use case.

Wizz-Vis is fully prepared to work with Druid as a backend, which performs a self-discovery of the data schema (datasources, dimensions and aggregators).

Also, a powerful API-REST is included to create and customize the widgets, including export and import them.
